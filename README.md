# Flow Design 

Flow Design is one of my first web design personal projects. Is a responsive landing page, for a fictional interior design studio.   

## Technologies

The project was realized using HTML, SASS, JAVASCRIPT and [Glider.js](https://nickpiscitelli.github.io/Glider.js/) for the clients comment carousel.
